# Fentanyl_Project1

1) Questions that you found interesting and what motivated you to answer them

* How much have fentanyl and other synthetic opiods driven overall opiod overdose deaths in the most recent past?
* Have certain demographic groups been affected more than others?



2) Where and how you found the data you used to answer these questions

* Sourced demographic data from The Home of the US Government's Open Data website, https://data.gov

3) The data exploration and cleanup process (accompanied by your Jupyter notebook)

* Once obtained, the process for the demographic data set involved understanding the figures being presented (i.e. number of overdose deaths per 100,000 individuals per calendar year) and isolating the subsets of data that were pertinent to our research (i.e. overall opioid overdose deaths with a focus on synthetic opioids).  Once the dataset was focused on our key subject matter, the readily available demographic data, of gender and age groups, was parsed out to isolate each demographic subgroup in order to visually present the trends from the years of 1999 through 2018.

* A similar process was used to produce a visualization of the impact of fentanyl and other synthetic opiods as compared to all opiods.


4) The analysis process (accompanied by your Jupyter notebook)

5) Your conclusions, including a numerical summary and visualizations of the summary

* By 2018, the impacts of opiod overdose deaths was more prominent with men than women, with the ratio of death rates of men to women was 2.23.
* The three most highly impacted age groups by opiod overdose deaths were, in descending order, 25 to 34 year olds, 35 to 44 year olds, and 45 to 54 year olds with death rates per 100k of 28.1, 27.7, and 23.0, respectively.  For perspective, the overall average death rate for 2018 was 14.3.

6) The implications of your findings: what do your findings mean?

* Overall, the data shows that a male using opioids, especially synthetics such as fentanyl, between the ages of 25 to 44 years old in the US is being more highly susceptible to overdosing as compared to the overall population.
